## Typical usage scenario

Use this widget to animate a display of a number, typically in a dashboard, to give the page a little bit of sizzle.
 
## Configuration

Can be used with simply setting the numerical entity attribute to animate. Each time that attribute is updated, the widget will animate the changing value for you.

### Advanced

Formatting: Control the use of grouping and number of decimals to display.
Behavior: Show with easing, using easeOutExpo from [http://robertpenner.com/easing/](http://robertpenner.com/easing/), or control the duration of the animation.
